      <description>Like most software and sysadmin nerds, I have a home lab. It&amp;rsquo;s a hodgepodge mix of old desktops, salvaged servers, and purchased equipment. I thought it might be interesting to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve done because it will also remind me how and what I&amp;rsquo;ve done. Here are the things that are worth mentioning:
 Running my own router [Slightly] more grown-up networking The charcuterie computing board Using Ansible (poorly) to install kubernetes Non-kubernetes dial-tone services: mysql and ldap Basic setup of a newly-installed kubernetes cluster  Kubernetes: installing calico and metallb Kubernetes: installing cert-manager for Ingress with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt Kubernetes: observability with telegraf, influx, and grafana Kubernetes: bare-metal volumes with TopoLVM    As I write an entry, I&amp;rsquo;ll turn the list above into links and the entries will link back to this post, which will be a table of contents post.</description>

      <description>My website used to be static html that I created with a little bit of bootstrap help. I love bootstrap - not least because its creator (mdo) is a fellow Hubber - but the truth is that I don&amp;rsquo;t need everything that it does. The truth is that I&amp;rsquo;m better with markdown than I am with HTML and CSS these days. So, why not make a static website using markdown? Enter Hugo!</description>
