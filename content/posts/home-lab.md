Like most software and sysadmin nerds, I have a home lab. It's a hodgepodge mix of old desktops, salvaged servers, and
purchased equipment. I thought it might be interesting to share what I've done because it will also remind me how and
what I've done. Here are the things that are worth mentioning:
- Running my own router
- [Slightly] more grown-up networking
- The ~~charcuterie~~ computing board
- Using Ansible (poorly) to install kubernetes
- Non-kubernetes dial-tone services: mysql and ldap
- Basic setup of a newly-installed kubernetes cluster
  - Kubernetes: installing calico and metallb
  - Kubernetes: installing cert-manager for Ingress with Let's Encrypt 
  - Kubernetes: observability with telegraf, influx, and grafana
  - Kubernetes: bare-metal volumes with TopoLVM

As I write an entry, I'll turn the list above into links and the entries will link back to this post, which will be a
table of contents post.
